## HTML

Remember that when you build a website you must always start with 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html> on the first line (index.html).
```
Here are some of the HTML-tags that we will be using in the head section of the html document.
```html
<html>  </html>
<head>  </head>  
<meta /> 
<title> </title> 
<link />
```

Here are some of the HTML-tags that we will be using in the body section of the html document. All HTML-tags in the body section are visibly for the human eye.

```html
<body> </body>
<nav> </nav>
<input type="checkbox"/>
<label> </label>
<ul> </ul>
<li> </li>
<a href=""> </a>
<section> </section>
<h1> </h1>
```

## CSS

Here are some of the CSS properties that we will be using to style our responsive navigation bar and website.
